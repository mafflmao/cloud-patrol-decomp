# cloud-patrol-decomp
A slightly functional decompilation of Skylanders Cloud Patrol
If you want to actually play it, start the game with the ElementSelect scene loaded, and it will let you select an element, and only a few actual work right now so if some dont work, you can edit the buttons in the scene to load a different skylander. I won't be fixing this until Cloud Patrol Plus development starts.
