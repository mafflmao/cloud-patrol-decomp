# DELETE THE LIBRARY FOLDER BEFORE USING THIS, AND ALSO EVERY TIME YOU OPEN THE PROJECT!!

# Cloud Patrol Decompilation
A slightly functional decompilation of Skylanders Cloud Patrol, in Unity 2022.3.37f1.
If you want to actually play it in the Unity Editor, start the game with the Splash scene loaded, and it will let you select an element, all of the elements work! 

# Cloud Patrol Plus
Cloud Patrol Plus is a project which will be built off of this decompilation project, and it will include all skylanders up to the superchargers hopefully. Development on this has not started yet, and will not start until I can find some people to help me with it :) thanks for reading
